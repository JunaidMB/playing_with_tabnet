# Tabnet with R

This repository uses the tidymodels framework to fit a Tabnet Neural Network on the NHS Stranded data. This data is provides a binary classification problem. Tabnet is a Neural Network model which is supposed to provide competitive performance on tabular data. In this repository, the aim is to compare Tabnet's performance with traditional ML methods.
